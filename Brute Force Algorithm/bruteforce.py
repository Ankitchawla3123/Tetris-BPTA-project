tetris_bruteforce_4x10_full.py
Standalone brute-force Tetris placer for a 4x10 board.

Edits: change `piece_sequence` near the bottom to run a custom sequence.
This script explores all placements (rotations + horizontal drops) for the given sequence,
applies gravity and line clears immediately after each placement, and reports the final
boards with the maximum total lines cleared.

WARNING: brute force grows exponentially with sequence length. Keep sequence short (N <= ~7)
if you want reasonable runtime/memory.
